## 📖 Chapter overview

The analysis, interpretation, and use of **geospatial data** are currently among the most relevant and useful tools for territorial planning and management, significantly contributing to the understanding of spatial dynamics and environmental processes.

This chapter aims to demonstrate the potential of **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** by leveraging the free availability of satellite imagery and highlighting its **educational value**.

The selected study area is located in **Casabermeja (Málaga, Spain)**, and the analysis focuses on land use and vegetation changes **before and after** the extreme weather event (**DANA**) that affected the region in October–November 2024.
